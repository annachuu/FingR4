## Features
- Preset button to fixed hand position
- Waves to audience once sensor senses a figure close enough in distance
- Preset gesture to motion people to come over every few minutes


## Materials
- **Arduino Uno R4 Circuit Board**
- **Breadboard**
  
- **Wires**: Connects input and output ports
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Senses the distance between people 
- **Button**: Preset buttons for specific hand positions and gestures
- **Servo Motors**: Acts as joints to display motion

- **Carboard**: As the main base material
- **Fish Wires**: Acting as the durable stirngs to pull/curl the fingers towards the palm
- **Straws**: Acts as the bones to contain the strings in place
